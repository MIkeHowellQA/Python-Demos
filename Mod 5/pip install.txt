PIP - Pip Installs Packages

PIP usually comes installed with Python.  It is a package installer.
It is a module.  I run it by typing:

 python -m pip

 However, pip often gets installed with a script wrapper that allow you to type
 pip directly into the command line.  The wrapper then runs the above.

 Different versions of the OS, installation, file search paths and all sorts can affect if pip
 appears to be installed at all.

 You can force pip to install (best run it as admin mode in windows command line to install it globally#
 in the Python install folder, if you can):

 python -m ensurepip --upgrade

 Unless the pip script is in the OS's search path, you may find typing in pip doesn't work.
 To be honest, rather use the "guaranteed" and more satisfying:

 python -m pip

 I say that because you can tell that pip is itself a module written in Python.
